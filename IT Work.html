										<h2>Interview Q&A</h2>
											<p>Callum MacPherson, Software Engineer, Black Magic Designs
											<br><b>Q1: Tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</b>
											<br>Answer: Currently I’m a Software Engineer at a company that manufactures equipment develops software for use in film making and live video production. My specific role at the moment is to develop and maintain software for embedded systems and desktop applications used in live video production.
											<br>
											<br><b>Q2: Tell us about the industry you work in.</b>
											<br>Answer: Working in manufacturing, I spend a lot of time hands-on with new products. As well as developing the software, I’m heavily involved in debugging the hardware and testing our products as part of a larger system. As our customers work in live events, the reliability of our software and hardware is extremely important.
											<br>
											<br><b>Q3: What other kinds of work do you have to do?</b>
											<br>Answer: I also get involved in writing documentation for our software, reviewing other engineer’s code, and delivering technical presentations to other teams in the company
											<br>
											<br><b>Q4: Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</b>
											<br>Answer:In a typical project cycle I will interact with: 
											<br>Software Engineers, Hardware Engineers, Quality Assurance Engineers / Testers, User Interface Designers, the Product Manager, Technical Writers and Translators
											<br>
											<br><b>Q5: Tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</b>
											<br>We have a team of seven software engineers. We each have our own assigned tasks, but support each other by sharing knowledge, helping think of solutions, and reviewing each other's code.
											<br>When working with new pieces of hardware, I'll work very closely with the Hardware Engineer(s) who designed it. I need to understand how the hardware is meant to work so I can write the software to drive it, and there is often some debugging to do (in both hardware and software).
											<br>I'll often go directly to the Product Manager if i have questions about how a feature should work from a end user's perspective. I might also give him a demonstration of something I'm working on the make sure I'm on the right track. This is similar to my interaction with UI designers, although they are more concerned with the fine details of the screen layouts, colours and typefaces.
											<br>The other people I've listed only interact with me occasionally, usually to ask questions about how a feature works or the meaning of certain technical terms.
											<br>
											<br><b>Q6: What about your interactions with clients or investors?</b>
											<br>As our company is quite large, we have dedicated staff who deal with customer support. So I typically don't interact with anyone outside the company. If a client/customer has a specific request, it would usually be forwarded from customer support to our Product Manager, who then decides whether to pass it on to us.
											<br>
											<br><b>Q7: What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</b>
											<br>Mostly reading/writing code and testing. Testing in particular is a huge part of my work, as our products often dorm part of a large live video production system, so it is important that everything works together.
											<br>
											<br><b>Q8: Which aspect of your work do you find the most challenging?</b>
											<br>With so many people of different backgrounds involved in our products, communicating effectively across teams can be challenging. As an engineer I often have to explain complicated technical concepts to people who don't have the same technical background as myself.
											<br>
											<br><b>Q9: Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</b>
											<br>I think the ATEM Television Studio is a great example.
											<br><a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/au/products/atemtelevisionstudio">Click here to find out more about them</a>
											<br>It is a mass-manufactured product with a powerful video & audio processing hardware, networking, and rich UI via the buttons and menu screen.
											<p>
										<h2>Work done by the IT professional</h2>
											<p>Mr MacPherson's work as a software engineer mainly involves writing code, reading code made by himself and his colleagues and testing the product before finalising it.</p>
										<h2>Types of people the IT professional interacts with</h2>
											<p>The people Mr MacPherson needs to interact are mainly other software engineers as they are in a team, hardware engineers in order to understand how to use the hardware, quality assurance engineers / testers, user interface designers to know how to lay out the UI of the product, the product manager, technical writers and translators. However, Mr MacPherson is not required to interact with customers as the company he works in is able to form a customer support team who are dedicated to dealing with customer problems.</p>
										<h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
											<p>Mr MacPherson spends most of his time writing code and reading the code of his colleagues, in addition to testing the code which consumes a significant amount of time due to the need for their product to work together with other products that where completed in the past.</p>
										<h2>The most challenging aspect of their position</h2>
											<p>The most challenging part of Mr MacPherson's work is communicating with the other teams of the company who are of different backgrounds than himself, which makes communicating difficult especially since the people of other teams don't have any knowledge in software engineering and requires thorough explanations on complex concepts of the work involved.</p>
