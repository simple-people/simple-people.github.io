										<h2>Personality Comparison</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Personality can generally reflect how well an individual can work in a group. For our group ‘Simple People’, we can make comparisons with the results of 3 different personality tests to get a basic understanding of the compatibility between our group members. The diverse personality types of every group member allows each of us to continue or complement each other’s works. For example, we all have a learning style of being a visual learner, this suggests that for all of us to gain an understanding of new notions, we should work with our strengths by understanding concepts visually. Our mixed personality types for the Myer-Briggs test illustrate diversity in our group and with diversity we can work to each other’s strengths and combat each others weaknesses. The groups’ unified personalities can have the added bonus benefit of having the best of all worlds with no drawbacks.  </p>

										<h2>Ideal Job Comparison</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A-J's Ideal Job: Junior Web Developer/Programmer
									<br/>Julia's Ideal Job: Application Developer
									<br/>Andy's Ideal Job: Software Engineer
									<br/>Jamie's Ideal Job: Level 3 IT Support
									<br/>Adrian's Ideal job: Information technology teacher
									<br/>Micheal's Ideal Job: Senior JavaScript Developer
									<br/>
									<br/>The ideal job of each member of the group directly relate to IT positions. All of us are willing to find jobs that help improve the future, and hopefully by coming together, we can all achieve this goal. Majority of the members were eager to enter a developer type of role where they are able to work in teams to build databases or create technological solution using programming languages such as: SQL, Java, HTML and more. Others such as Adrian aim to have a more direct approach of helping the future by teaching the next generation about IT, while Jamie aims to help the public as a troubleshooter, where he can work alone or as a team to fix desktops and servers.</p>
