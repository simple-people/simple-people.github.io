											<h2 id="content">An Augmented Reality price comparison application</h2>
											<p>Using the camera from a smartphone, a user can take a photo of an appliance or object and while using the application it will give on-screen details about the pictured product and compare the product in other stores and departments to find the best possible price.												<br>Our Project idea is that of an Augmented Reality price comparison application. The app will work by accessing the user’s phone camera and scanning any item that is captured in the camera. If the app recognises any items in the view of the camera, it will then scan through known retailers’ websites checking if they stock the same (or similar) item, if so, it will compare the price and capabilities of the items sold by the retailers. When the user finds the price and store they want, they could either click a link that would send them directly to the store’s website and item page, or they can decide to go to the store in person.
											<br>By informing the user of various or better prices found the application will also notify the user where to find it according to the distance from the user’s current location to the retailer. This app ensures the user can always get the best price on everything that they buy, to do so the app will make use of artificial intelligence which has gone through training that gives it the ability to recognise what item it has scanned.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="major">
											<h2>How the App might work and how it could be created</h2>
											<p>For this program to work, the items would need to be stored in a database system that would arrange and file each item by store and price. The problem, however, is that there would be millions of items that need to added to the systems to make this project work. Therefore an AI program would need to be created or implemented to the database that would be able to search for every new item added, as well as any possible price changes a store might have made, and filter and file them into the correct area.
											<br>To create the application, we might use Vuforia Augmented Reality Software Developer Kit as Vuforia’s engine is able to build a 3D AR program, suitable for our project. Using Java, as well as the Unity3D engine that is supported by Vuforia, we should be able to highlight various items using 2D and 3D image targeting and add them to a database later to be tested. When highlighting an item, a drop-down menu should appear, showing the alternative retailers and the prices of the item so that the user can tap onto and visit the store website. Vuforia also supports both IOS and Android devices, so most mobile device users would be able to obtain the application through the App store or Google Play. Of course, this is not the definitive method of create the AR app, as there are many different kinds of AR software development kit out there.
											<br>Overall, the aim of our project is to create a convenient app in which users can quickly and easily compare the price of a product with the prices from other stores and departments so that the user can find a cheaper alternative to what they need. An efficient solution to solve an issue that everyone faces everyday whenever they go out to buy something, this AR program would help speed up that process with just a camera and a click of a button.

											<h2>Project Description</h2>
											<h3>Aim and Goals</h3>
											<p>The aim of the project is to create an application that takes a photo of an item, the application then recognises it and compares the product with different stores to find the cheapest place to purchase it in proximity to the user’s location.
											<br>One of the project’s goal is to give users more convenience when shopping as they will not need to manually look for different retailers that provide the same product and compare each of their prices. Instead the user will be able to simply capture a photo of the product and a list of cheaper options will quickly appear on the screen of their device saving a significant amount of time the user can use more productively.
											</p>
											<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
											<p>Simple People began with a group of people filled with a love for information technology and video games. We first had aspirations to focus our intent towards a video game related project. This was deemed difficult as creatively we failed to create a concept for a game we were satisfied with. This lead to our focus on virtual reality and all the possibilities it provides with the still growing technology related to this area. This lead to ideas in relation to the convenience it can provide hence our focus aimed towards virtual reality and the related area of augmented reality due to the convenience and entertainment able to be obtained through these technological advancements. Finally the spark to our idea of an augmented reality price comparison application came to motion. The thought of being able to use an application in store to determine the cheapest price available for a specific product would be convenient for on the fly shopping as our project aims to combat this particular issue.
											<br>We have researched and failed to find an exact representation of our product with the main feature of being an augmented reality price comparison. Similar products and websites however have been researched such as Google Lens, OzBargain and Honey which have features we wish to implement into our own application present. These features being the AI recognition, and focus on finding the cheapest price available for products.
											<br>Google Lens is a Google Pixel-exclusive feature which uses an AI system to detect and understand the object presented through the camera. This parallels our aim to create an AI to regnose products from an object in the photo, however Google Lens acts as a general AI recognition being able to identify plants, books, animals and more. We want to specialise in price comparison to help consumers obtain the best price for the specified product.
											<br>Currently a few retail stores such as clothing brand, American Apparel, have integrated AR technology into their in-store experience. They have created a mobile application which scans a picture of signage and displays product details, with customer reviews, colour variants and pricing. This parallels our product to an extent however the app is focused on a particular brand and will not provide our main focus of the cheapest price across numerous stores.
											<br>Generally most consumers use a website such as OzBargain and perform their own research on the internet to find the best price possible. OzBargain in particular is an online website for Australians which acts similar to a forum for users to post current or upcoming deals and coupons for products or brands. The website is mostly reliant on user-input to post the deals. Another options consumers may use is Honey which is a free browser extension used to save money as it automatically searches for deals and coupons in its database during check-out while online shopping. As a free extension it makes money through commissions from merchants with a portion back to the user through their reward system. From Ozbargain and Honey we can learn we could either have a user-based database or an online database. We have decided to go to an online database route for more accuracy and reliability.
											<br>Part of the concept of our project also takes inspiration from the Google Translate an application which can translate a multitude of languages being an almost instant translation while out and about. It is a useful tool for everyday life with how easily it can bridge the gap between languages. In the same way as Google Translate we aim to help consumers while out and about in store with their shopping requirements.
											<br>To further develop the concept we investigated the tools and technology required in relation to building the features of the application. This lead to us learning about the engine Vuforia, an augmented reality software development kit for mobile devices, enabling us to create an augmented reality application. Vuforia already has a system able to search for similar elements between a reference image and another image as it processes the reference image and finds feature points in the new image presented. Hence Vuforia will be a prime tool used to make the AI recognition feature of our application.
											<br>Our vision of an augmented reality price comparison app at this point was still simply a concept due to our lack of experience and ability related to the tools and technology involved. Thus we aim to develop the concept and design stages of our project to help us either when as a group we have more experience or hand it off to more experienced people.
											<br>We had reached a dead end to the AI feature of our application as all we could perform was research about the tools required and lacked the skills and time required to make a prototype with this feature. This resulted in us creating a baseline to define the core feature of a price comparison app to give our project a reasonable scope. Instead of an AI system we would first focus on a barcode scanner which would display price comparisons in AR. Items generally have a universal barcode hence this would be the easiest way for our app to accurately determine the prices of the product.
											<br>To aid development of our project we have created low fidelity wireframe to be a representation of our final product and help investors see a visual representation of the application. Below are are the low fidelity wireframes which represents the steps taken by the user to use the app. In these particular wireframes the user wants to find out the cheapest price for a playstation 4 hence they would open the app and scan the barcode. This would take them to the list of cheapest prices for the product. In order from one to four the figures display this scenario.
											</p>
											<h3>Roles</h3>
											<p>The group would not need any specific roles as we are equally sharing the task among each other. Each member can loosely fit the roles of technical designer, project manager  or user interface designer depending on what idea they want to input into the project. The group would input any ideas into the project such as what features the software would need to work, how the user would be able to use the application or what the application would look like to the user . There would be also be one or two members of the group explaining what needs to be done by a specific time, leading the team to finish the project in time.
											</p>
											<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
											<p>The baseline of our project will be the implementation of an app that can scan item barcodes and project details about the item on screen. This will require a software which can scan and recognise item barcodes and search through a database to project relevant information about the product.
											<br>Due to the constraints of our ability in relation to augmented reality it is more feasible to create an app that scans barcodes and have a database to parallel that. This database could be limited to a number of products to test the database.
											<br>With the project initially developed for assignment purposes, the time given to produce a concept and a prototype was limited. With the addition of the project being designed by inexperienced university students, we don't have the required skill set and tools required to produce this project idea.
											</p>
											<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
											<p>Software that would be required would include Wrike as it would allow for more organised and efficient work if it is planned beforehand. Using Invision Studio to create high fidelity prototypes to test certain things before the development of the mobile application is started which will be done on Appy Pie which will then use a barcode scanner app. This is available on the Google Playstore called ’Barcode Scanner’ made by ‘ZXing Team’, a similar program could be built from scratch and then implemented into our app using the original as the inspiration.
											<br>The created software should have a viewfinder which guides the user as to how close they should take the photo and an outline is displayed on screen as to show the fitting area for the barcode.
											<br>I have used QR scanners previously and most of those apps indicate when the code has been read successfully recognised and presents a URL to tap on.
											<br>In this instance the product’s price would be displayed as well as a link to the company’s store showing the product.
											<br>A specific licence to the stores’ databases would be required as the barcode’s SKU is unique to each store such as Woolworths or Coles. However the the UPC of a product is the same for all of the same products. Oracle SQL Developer will be used to create a database which may be stored on a server from Digital Ocean.
											<br>Development of the application will be done on computers which will then be used on Android and Apple phones to test the applications functionality.
											</p>
											<h3>Testing</h3>
											<p>The project will be tested in two areas being the UX and the functionality of the project. The UX will be tested through the use of high fidelity prototypes that will closely resemble the final product, and having around 4 - 5 participants found at storefronts to complete a set of tasks designated to them. By observing the difficulties the user experiences we will be able to improve the UI of the project, which in turn will improve the UX of the users.
											<br>The second type of testing done will be checking whether the project functions as intended, such as whether the barcode is properly scanned and if so will the correct product information be retrieved from the servers or if the software can properly identify the product captured in the camera. By doing this testing will prevent the possibility of releasing a product to the potential users that is filled with bugs, which will become a deterrence to people from using the app.
											</p>
											<h3>Timeframe</h3>
											<p>
											</p>
											<h3>Risks</h3>
											<p>Following through with this project could bring about certain risks that can cause significant delays and problems with the app. The most important risk is that all members of the Simple People group do not specialize in any fields that is needed for the completion of the project. Due to this if there is not enough funds it will be difficult to hire people with experience, and if none are hired and the members attempt to learn how to complete the project it would take much longer than what is planned and the app will likely be riddled with problems that the members overlook due to inexperience. Users of such an app will undoubtedly be infuriated by the numerous problems of the app, creating a negative reputation for the Simple People group.
											<br>Other risks include how the finish product may work. Due to the number of new items brought into stores as well as possible price changes for items on a daily basis, it’ll be very difficult to keep up to date with all the current items in every store. For the product to succeed, the team needs to find a way to keep up to date with every possible items. One way to help fix this problem is to team up with large businesses so that we can share their database and keep their item information up to date.
											</p>
											<h3>Group processes and Communication</h3>
											<p>
											</p>
										</div>
										<div>
											<h2>Skills and Jobs<h2>
											<h3>Project Manager</h3>
											<p>This role will be needed throughout the entire project. This member would decide how to approach the project and decide what roles would be needed to complete the design and assign the tasks to each member of the group. They would oversee the entire project in terms of: how it is presented, fixing any issues that appear, creating a schedule and most importantly, lead the team.
											</p>
											<h3>Software Developers</h3>
											<p>This role would be assigned to the members of the development to create a workable prototype. These members would develop a database server to store the items to be tested, an AR software that helps scan the items to compare them with other retail stores and any other software that is needed to be implemented.
											</p>
											<h3>Tachnical Lead/Lead Developer<h3>
											<p>This role will be needed during the planning stages as they help understand what the clients would want from the project, and what technical aspects would be needed to complete the solution. The Technical Lead should be able to effectively communicate with the Project Manager on the status of the project so that any issues or changes can be addressed as soon as possible.
											</p>
											<h3>Database Administrator</h3>
											<p>The database administrator is a specialise that would help model, design and create a working database for the project. This database would need to contain the details of the items, such as its name, price, and location, and with the millions of items needed to be stored, a database administrator will be very important. The database would also need to be regularly checked for when items change prices in their respective stores.
