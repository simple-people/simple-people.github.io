										<h2 id="content">An Augmented Reality price comparison application</h2>
										<p>Using the camera from a smartphone, a user can take a photo of an appliance or object and while using the application it will give on-screen details about the pictured product and compare the product in other stores and departments to find the best possible price.
									        </p>
									<p>By informing the user of various or better prices found the application will also notify the user where to find it according to the distance from the user’s current location to the retailer. This app ensures the user can always get the best price on everything that they buy, to do so the app will make use of artificial intelligence which has gone through training that gives it the ability to recognise what item it has scanned.
										</p>
									<p><b>How the App might work and how it could be created</b>
										<br>For this program to work, the items would need to be stored in a database system that would arrange and file each items by store and price. The problem however, is that there would be millions of items that need to added to the systems to make this project work. Therefore an AI program would need to be created or implemented to the database that would be able to search for every new item added, as well as any possible price changes a store might have made, and filter and file them into the correct area.
										</p>
									<p>To create the application, we might use Vuforia Augmented Reality Software Developer Kit as Vuforia’s engine is able to build a 3D AR program, suitable for our project. Using Java, as well as the Unity3D engine that is supported by Vuforia, we should be able to highlight various items using 2D and 3D image targeting and add them to a database later to be tested. When highlighting an item, a drop-down menu should appear, showing the alternative retailers and the prices of the item so that the user can tap onto and visit the store website. Vuforia also supports both IOS and Android devices, so most mobile device users would be able to obtain the application through the App store or Google Play. Of course this is not the definitive method of create the AR app, as there are many different kinds of AR software development kit out there.
										</p>
									<p>Overall, the aim of our project is to create a convenient app in which users can quickly and easily compare the price of a product with the prices from other stores and departments so that the user can find a cheaper alternative to what they need. An efficient solution to solve an issue that everyone faces everyday whenever they go out to buy something, this AR program would help speed up that process with just a camera and a click of a button.
