										<h2>Clouds, Services and Servers</h2>
											<p><b>What does it do?</b>
											<br>Clouds, services and servers include things such as OneDrive, iCloud, DropBox, Netflix and Spotify. These services can bring forward things like movies, tv shows and music on demand. These are stored on offshore servers which can be accessed by the global masses. This sudden trend of digital mass media has removed and replaced physical things like DVDs, CDs and even physical video games. Stores such as BlockBuster and VideoEZY and other rental services have minimised or have completely disappeared due to the rise of services such as Netflix and Hulu which are server orientated.
											<br>
											<br>The current state of this technology is extremely popular almost worldwide. Services such as Netflix, Spotify and Hulu have become recognised worldwide due to their free trials or Spotify which can provide FREE music at the cost of advertisements. Free trials and other free content are simply not possible or is a hassle on physical media. Within the next three years, it is expected that digital services shun out physical media completely. Take Microsoft’s all new Xbox One which now does not even feature a physical Blu-ray disc drive as to push the future of an all-digital world through Xbox Marketplace. Sony has introduced PlayStation Now which is a streaming service for the Sony PlayStation 4 which allows it to become backwards compatible with the Sony PlayStation 3 through streaming the game off of Sony’s own servers. 
											<br>
											<br>The original Sony PlayStation 3 launched for a whopping $600 because of how expensive it was to manufacture all these extra needs of USBs, card readers, expansion slots and other media. Despite the enormous and hefty price tag, Sony would lose around $200 per PlayStation 3 sold. Through the next generation, they removed majority of these features and could finally start profiting from the PlayStation 3. 
											<br>
											<br>The future of video games could purely turn to games being streamed from a developer such as Activision, through their own servers to a console. Eliminating the need for a powerful computer parts such as a speedy CPU, GPU and RAM. This can eliminate manufacturing costs and can allow Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to reduce prices for their consoles from $399 to as low as $99.
											<br>
											<br>Cloud computing such as OneDrive allow businesses and users to rely on a cloud storage solution which backs up the ‘cloud’ without the user ever having to worry about anything except an internet connection. The term cloud in this scenario refers to an offshore computer which has all of that information stored and is displayed to a user. Such services allow for a convenient and hassle-free solution and has almost eliminated the use of USBs altogether. The content is available anywhere... At the need of an internet connection. 
											<br>
											<br>However, it is not all positive. These cloud services are open to hackers and even the cloud provider themselves could be making backups of your personal information or viewing the content. Cloud computing becomes futile the moment a power or internet connection loss occurs. A traditional USB, SD card or external hard drive can not fail you in that regard. 
											<br>
											<br><b>What is the likely impact?</b>
											<br>The likely impact is this will make manufacturing video game consoles much cheaper than it currently is and the low-price tag could invite even more people into the gaming community. This can introduce a throwaway culture of buy and replace rather than restore and repair which may not be beneficial for the environment. 
											<br>
											<br>The future could see a complete loss of compact discs, movie rental stores, USBs, external hard disk drives, USB-A connectivity and other current physical equipment. The one cable to live through this revolution is the new reversible USB C cable. It is capable of 10GBps and can give a power output of up to 20 volts. No other cable such as the lightning, micro or mini USB is capable of either of these.  
											<br>
											<br>This all digital route leads to a more environmentally friendly route as no discs or plastic is created. However, this opens the vulnerability to always be dependent on electronic means and matters, which is not ideal if heavy internet traffic is present. 
											<br>
											<br>People who develop discs, manufacture cables, cords, plastics and other cover materials are likely to lose their jobs due to the uprising of the digital information technology world. 
											<br>
											<br><b>How will this affect you?</b>
											<br>Personally, all of this will affect me. I prefer physical media such as DVDs, Blu-rays and CDs rather than downloadable or streamable content. For a video game console, I would prefer to own a physical copy of the games as well as to have my console actually run the game itself for maximum performance for reflex based games such as shooting or driving games. I would prefer the ability to play these offline as with a streaming console, this would not be possible. 
											<br>
											<br>My family members would always prefer the ways of yesteryear and would not come kindly to gadgets missing headphone jacks or other universal peripherals. They also prefer compact discs for music as well as digital video discs for movies rather than watching it off of a streaming service. 
											</p>
										<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
											<p><b>What does it do?</b>
											<br>Machine learning is the concept which gives a system the ability to mimic human intelligence in the ability to improve from experience. It is done so from being given an algorithm and a set of sample data which the system will run through and mutates their algorithm to improve their performance, as such the larger the sample data the more effective the system will be. There are different ways to train a machine being supervised learning and unsupervised learning and within supervised learning is the categories, classification and regression, and in unsupervised learning there is clustering, all three of which contain different types of methods in each of them. The method used to train is chosen from the three categories depending on what the machine is to learn.
											<br>
											<br>This technology does not have the best of its kind for all situations and instead there are different algorithms used for specific situations and circumstances that it is designed for. An example of this is Semantic Segmentation, which is certain algorithms designed to recognize patterns in an image, will not work when used to analyze and interpret the context of a sentence or paragraph which NPL modeled algorithms are designed to do. Meaning you could consider multiple different algorithms to be ‘state of the art’ and there would be many of which that could take this title for what they do even those whose purpose that would be considered useless in many people’s eyes.
											<br>
											<br>Using the current machine learning technology, it is possible to train an AI to analyze data automatically which can be used on new sets of data with great accuracy if trained well enough with a diverse and large set of sample data, though in exchange much more time proportional to the amount of data being used as training material will be needed. And it is already possible to create robots that can mimic humans to the degree that normal interaction between two humans is possible with a machine, such as sports, speech and physical contact. Other uses of machine learning which has already been done would be self-driving cars that are able to find patterns in a video feed from an external camera in real-time and can judge the possibility that it could lead to an accident, thus giving it the ability to completely avoid endangering the passengers inside to harm. Or even security features such as face and fingerprint recognition on our own devices such as phones, tablets and computers, which uses an algorithm that learns and stores a specific pattern in the users face and/or fingerprint when set-up.
											<br>
											<br>In the near future it seems likely that machine learning will become more powerful and efficient in both the training phase and usage as a product, this can improve many existing functionalities within many applications such as visual recognition and speech understanding. In addition, could affect the development of technology that is needed to use machine learning in a very positive direction due to the research and development being pushed to improve performance and efficiency of the computing capabilities.
											<br>
											<br>However, to make full use of machine learning other technology is needed such as electrical engineering, robotics, software development and computer science to create AIs, robots and software that can all be put together or used separately for a variety of purposes.
											<br>
											<br><b>What is the likely impact?</b>
											<br>As mentioned before the development of this technology will likely improve technology with computing capabilities such as CPUs for better efficiency and performance since machine learning requires very powerful CPUs to be able to train the machines quickly. And If the CPU has poor performance than it is likely that it will not be able to train in mass quantities, which will affect the time to train and quality of the machine’s capabilities. As such, the more powerful a CPU is the better the training of the machine can be in both time and performance.
											<br>
											<br>Something that is certain to change would be the learning algorithms for the machines, with methods and techniques to create much more efficient algorithms. This is to allow more room in processing power for extra training and for more intelligent algorithms that will learn faster.
											<br>
											<br>The development of this technology will likely affect business owners that are involved with the research and development and/or retail of technology such as phones, computers, wearable devices and home appliances like Google Home. Where they will likely implement more developed AIs into these devices as they become better with the development of machine learning.
											<br>
											<br>This technology by itself will not replace any current jobs or make them redundant as it cannot do anything but train machines to do what they are being trained for.  However, with the addition of other technologies it could affect many jobs that involve calculations and being compiled into a report for example accountants would need to calculate many things from many different documents, predicting future expenses and profit, create reports that summarizes the documents and then probably providing advice for future decisions involving the finance of the business which could be done far quicker if done by a machine that can calculate many times faster than a human being and provide advice that is relevant to the current information as it is able to be constantly up to date with all relevant information through the internet. Though it can could still create some new jobs that will involve the research to find better methods and techniques and development of this technology to be used to train machines.
											<br>
											<br><b>How will this affect you?</b>
											<br>The daily life of people could change into a something that involves AIs that will be almost always around us wherever we are to provide assistance automatically when needed. As AIs learning capabilities will become more advanced and will have the ability to learn various information about its owner, allowing them to know when something is wrong such as learning the route to their workplace and providing navigation when the owner starts heading in the wrong direction or finding irregularities in their owners health.
											<br>
											<br>Life will be even more reliant on technology than it is currently and eventually it will be expected for the machines to understand when and what is wrong. However, it will likely be too expensive for a family with normal income and probably be almost exclusively owned by high income families for a while before prices will eventually drop when more advanced technology is created or a variant that requires much less expenses to manufacture is developed.
											</p>
										<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
											<p><b>What does it do?</b>
											<br>Autonomous vehicles, also known as a self-driving car or driverless car, is a vehicle that operates without human intervention. Autonomous vehicles aim to be a convenient and safe method of transportation due to the lack of human error. It is therefore required to obey road rules while quickly but safely react to unexpected situations more accurately under all circumstances.
											<br>
											<br>Currently, the state of the technology is to the extent of implementing autonomous features such as a self-parking system. In Australia, a few companies have already implemented a self-parking system such as Ford’s Focus and Volkswagen Golf. A fully automated vehicle, however, is still in the works with some companies such as Tesla, Waymo, Uber and Google’s autonomous car design which has been tested on American roads however is not commercially available. 
											<br>
											<br>Autonomous vehicles are achieved through a built-in system within the vehicle to analyse the surroundings and make accurate and automatic action immediately when required. Generally, autonomous vehicles use GPS, detection technology and/or on-board computers. In the case of Google specifically, the part of the business under the name Waymo, have installed all the technology described previously - GPS, sensors and computer systems- in Toyota Prius and Lexus Vehicles which have been road-tested in Nevada and Florida. A 3D map of the vehicle’s surroundings is generated with a laser mounted on the roof of the car combining the measurements in the system with pre-installed maps. It would respect traffic laws while avoiding obstacles sensed by also the radars on the front and rear bumpers.
											<br>
											<br>Currently, there is an international standard for measuring degrees of automation in cars created by the Society of Automotive Engineers call J3016. It is a scale from 0 to 5 - level 0 being no automation and level 5 being fully automated. From level, 1 to 2 features are present to support the driver while level 3 to 4 is an automated car under certain predetermined conditions. 
											<br>
											<br>Despite companies progress in the advanced stages of testing in the creation of autonomous vehicles, there are still technical and ethical challenges that oppose their implementation. Mainly the problem that humans pose as both the driver and pedestrian - with unpredictable behaviour poses a challenge for technology. The Google car itself has experienced an incident due to human-error in July of 2015. The incident was caused by a human driver’s failure to stop causing the autonomous Google vehicle to be hit by the driver which resulted in injury for a few of the passengers. The way in which autonomous vehicles interact with pedestrians also raises moral and ethical questions for the manufacturers of the vehicles. The vehicles are expected to understand pedestrian behaviour while mimicking behaviour expected from a human driver. Programming into the computer systems of the vehicle also comes at the risk of being hacked and manipulated by third-parties. Until the issues are solved, fully autonomous vehicles will only pose a risk to other road users. Thus, it is expected that for the next few years we will only get to experience partial autonomous technology as fully autonomous vehicles need to be tested for absolute certainty for the safety of all on the road.
											<br>
											<br><b>What is the likely impact?</b>
											<br>We should expect further development of autonomous technology being implemented globally while will aid as progress towards a fully autonomous vehicle. Due to the negative implications of fully autonomous vehicles that are still apparent the implementations of the vehicles on roads will not be expected soon. Such implications that pose ethical and technical problems must be solved in order for a safe and fully functional autonomous vehicle to be road safe. 
											<br>
											<br>Trust in the technology must be built as the main argument against self-driving cars is the potential hazard it may cause for road users. With currently no definite way to prove the safety of the vehicle with the presence of so many variables on the road, we can not expect autonomous vehicles to be road-safe immediately.
											<br>
											<br>Autonomous vehicles will mostly affect road-users, manufacturers, and businesses. With the state of the technology currently, it only poses a hazard to drivers and pedestrians. However ideally once the technology has been perfected, drivers can expect a more convenient experience on the road with an automated vehicle that can be trusted to keep the safety of all road users to the fullest of their abilities. It would theoretically reduce the number of road accidents and protect more people in the long run. For manufacturers and businesses, the implementation of autonomous vehicles can have both positive and negative implications to accommodate the advancements of this new technology. Such changes like vehicle manufacturers will need to shift to developing and creating these autonomous vehicles as they work alongside creators of the hardware and software. For businesses, developing this new technology is a business opportunity for profit and a greater reputation. However, these manufacturers and businesses first must solve the issues that autonomous vehicles poses currently until it is legalised on the roads.
											<br>
											<br><b>How will this affect you?</b>
											<br>
											<br>Until autonomous vehicles are fully operational and legalised on the road, everybody should only to expect partially automated technology being implemented - this will ideally provide convenience and safety for the users. I personally expect and hope automated technology, for not only vehicles, to be enhanced and available to aid in my daily life. 
											<br>
											<br>Once autonomous vehicles are present on the road however, all road-users are expected to be affected as they will be the ones interacting with the new technology.
											<br>
											<br>This will personally affect me as a driver on Australian roads who must abide by the technological change and adjust to being aware there is a chance I will encounter such technology on the road or be riding within one. This gives me hope for a more convenient future with automated vehicles helping all in their daily lives to get from one location to another within minimal or less effort. I first expect, however, that all the technical and ethical issues of autonomous vehicles to be solved once it is implemented. Trust with the new technology must be built as lives are affected therefore manufacturers and business must solve all the issues to the fullest extent. No one would be expected to approve of an unreliable, hazardous vehicle on the road. Vehicles in general already pose a hazard to all road-users hence if an incident were to occur it could be life-threatening. I would not support the implementation of an autonomous vehicle without it being tested to an absolute certainty that it would be safer than a human driving for anyone on the road. My families and friends are expected to be affected in a similar way as they would be road-users as well with similar or the same expectation.
